In my preview of The Expedition I have started at the end. Working backwards seemed like the logical thing to do for this project in my mind so the resolution is the preview. Our main character is running through the woods trying to escape from something the audience is unsure of at the moment. He is able to safely arrive at his car and start the ignition. I was able to use tracks from freesound.org to record this segment. I overlaid the backgrounds of birds and wind blowing through the trees with the quick footsteps through grass so it is obvious he is running through nature. This on top of heavy quick paced breathes helps eliminate even more doubt that the character is running away from something. A moment I was very proud of while working was when I needed to slow the footsteps down because our main character arrived at his car. I was able to slow the footsteps as he opened the door, and keep the nature sounds playing until he closed the door. This paints the picture where the man is now in his car safe and out of breath. He is able to insert the key into the ignition as he regains his breath and start the car to prepare to drive away. My self recorded sounds are saved in my file but do not come until later in recording. I used an ivy plant I keep in my room to simulate the sounds of climbing up and sliding down vines in the cave. When overlaid with a track simulating a cave, and an obvious plant on the ground or push to the top of a ledge, I think it should be obvious that our main character has descended or ascended a level within the cave.
